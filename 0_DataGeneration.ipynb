    "# Industrial machinery simulator for AI-enabled IoT scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a production IoT Predictive Maintenance solution requires having mature remote condition monitoring infrastructure in place. More specifically, data-driven prognostics hinge on the availability of statistically significant amounts of run-to-failure telemetry and maintenance records, from which equipment degradation patterns can be learned to enable failure predications based on both historical and newly collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world run-to-failure data sets are virtually impossible to come across due to their commercially sensitive nature. Of the several publicly available synthetic data sets[[1]](#ref_1)[[2]](#ref_2), none ideally fits the canonical IoT scenario in which highly irregular real-time data streams from sensors are captured and used for condition monitoring or anomaly detection[[3]](#ref_3). For instance, the tiny *Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set* [[1]](#ref_1) created with the commercial version of the *Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation* environment (C-MAPSS) [[4]](#ref_4) contains a single telemetry snapshot per operational cycle of unspecified length, whereas the data set which accompanies the *Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide* [[2]](#ref_2) features hourly, presumably aggregated, sensor readings produced by making statistical alterations to uncorrelated series of random numbers. Unfortunately, the source code used for generating these data sets is not publicly available (in fact, obtaining C-MAPSS requires a grant from the U.S. Government). This makes the tasks of converting these data sets to a format which bears more resemblance to that of an IoT-centered scenario and generating new customized data for real-time simulation rather difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to data generation presented in this Notebook is an attempt to simulate a hypothetical IoT-enabled manufacturing environment comprised of generalized rotational equipment, which may include pumps, turbines, gearboxes, compressors, and engines. The end product is a customizable open-source physics-inspired simulation framework which can be used for generating arbitrarily large seed data for model training as well as real-time telemetry streams for performing interactive end-to-end testing and validation of a complete AI-enabled IoT solution. (Suitability for RUL, multiclass classification and failure detection - elaborate.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated data set will be a combination of maintenance and telemetry records. It is assumed that sensor data, along with the values describing a machine's current operational settings (in this case, rotational speed), is periodically transmitted from an IoT Edge device, with or without preprocessing, to the cloud where it is used for predictive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintenance and failure records\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present implementation, the maintenance data set will contain primarily failure events indicating exact points in time when a machine had a critical failure of a particular type. The intent of Predictive Maintenance is preventing these events by raising alarms in advance, so that appropriate preventive activities can be carried out.\n",

    "### Operational settings, operational conditions and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operational settings* determine the mode of operation and have a substantial effect on the observed performance and other monitored phenomena. For rotational equipment, one of the possible operational settings is the \"desired\" speed expressed in rotations per minute (RPM). Other operational settings may come into play in real-world scenarios. (For instance, the *Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set* [[1]](#ref_1) contains three operational settings.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operational conditions* define the environment in which equipment is being operated. Weather conditions, location, characteristics of the operator are some of the examples. Operational conditions may impact the performance of the equipment and therefore should be taken into account in predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Performance* is determined by current operational settings, operational conditions and physical state of the equipment (e.g., wear). In this example, performance is expressed as a set of the following sensor measurements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- speed (actual)\n",
    "- temperature\n",
    "- pressure\n",
    "- vibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of the equipment, some sensors will measure useful output, and some the side effects of mechanical or other processes (or, in energy terms, the loss). Most of the time, upcoming failures manifest themselves in a gradually diminishing useful output and increased loss under some or all operational settings; for example, assuming that pressure is considered \"useful output,\" a machine operating at the same speed would generate increasingly less pressure while, possibly, also producing more heat or vibration. Performance measurements often exhibit some complex nonlinear behavior with respect to operational settings, operational conditions and equipment health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea behind Predictive Maintenance is that different types of impending failures manifest themselves in different ways over time, and that such patterns can be learned given sufficient amount of collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different failure modes due to unspecified physical damage will be simulated by imposing independent time-varying health indices, $h_i(t)$, with randomly chosen failure propagation parameters ($a_i$, $b_i$). Each of the $N$ simulated devices will start with a random non-zero initial deterioration to account for variations due to age, manufacturing defects and other unknown factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each device will be simulated under a randomized sequence of changing over time operational settings (speed in this case), producing telemetry time series containing all observable performance and operational measurements impacted by the current values of the health indices. Whenever any of the health indices drops below its threshold (a value dependent on the failure mode), a correspoinding record will be added to the maintenance log.\n",
    "\n",
    "All generated telemetry data will be contaminated with sensor noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operational settings\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point in time, a rotational machine has a certain desired speed expressed in revolutions per minute (RPM). This speed can vary (i.e., the engine may start, stop, gradually accelerate or decelerate) or be relatively static.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below demonstrates how smooth variations over time can be modeled by means of cubic or linear interpolation."
